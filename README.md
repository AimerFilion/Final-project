# Montreal Music Venues: MMV
My final project. A website where all Montreal music venues are gathered in one place. 

## About
The aim of this project was to create a centralized wev app that allow users to skip the step of manually searching through individual venue websites, to view events. The web app would allow users to discover new artists/bands close to their area. My primary focus is to give visibility to local bands or bands that are not yet well-established.
