# Montreal Music Venues
‚≠ê My final project. A website where events, from various Montreal local venues, are gathered in one place. 
üå± Technologies: JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, Express.js, Git/Github,REST APIs, HTML, CSS, jQuery, styled-components and MongoDB.

## About
The aim of this project was to create a centralized web app, which would allow users to skip the step of viewing events by manually searching through each individual venue's website. The web app would allow users to discover new artists/bands close to their area. My primary focus is to give visibility to local bands or bands that are not yet well-established.
